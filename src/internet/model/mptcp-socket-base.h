/**
 * \ingroup socket
 * \class MpTcpSocketBase
 *
 * \brief A base class for implementation of a stream socket using MPTCP.
 * This is the MPTCP meta socket the application talks with
 * this socket. New subflows, as well as the first one (the master
 * socket) are linked to this meta socket.
 * Every data transfer happens on a subflow.
 * Following the linux kernel from UCL (http://multipath-tcp.org) convention,
 * the first established subflow is called the "master" subflow.
 *
 * This inherits TcpSocketBase so that it can be  used as any other TCP variant:
 * this is the backward compability feature that is required in RFC.
 * Also doing so allows to run TCP tests with MPTCP via for instance the command
 * Config::SetDefault ("ns3::TcpL4Protocol::SocketType", "ns3::MpTcpOlia");
 *
 * But to make sure some inherited functions are not improperly used, we need to redefine them so that they
 * launch an assert. You can notice those via the comments "//! Disabled"
 *
 * As such many inherited (protected) functions are overriden & left empty.
 *
 * As in linux, the meta should return the m_endPoint information of the master,
 * even if that subflow got closed during the MpTcpConnection.
 *
 * ConnectionSucceeded may be called twice; once when it goes to established
 * and the second time when it sees
 * Simulator::ScheduleNow(&MpTcpSocketBase::ConnectionSucceeded, this);
